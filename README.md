## Project title:
# Water Quality Prediction:
The project involves a Machine Learning model, which predicts the type, quality of multiple types of water,
and either it is safe to drink or not using machine learning techniques, MultiOutputRegressor around a RandomForestRegressor.
## Project Description:
In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
- Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
- Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor
- Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics
## Steps involved:
Loading the dataset.  
Preprocess the dataset.  
Handle null values.  
Visualize the data.  
Select feature and target variables.  
Perform Train,test and split.  
Train and evaluate the model.  
Classify and deploy the model.  
## Predicted Water Quality Parameters:
The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:
- NH4
- BOD5 (BSK5)
- Colloids
- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and
- CL
## Classification:
Model predicts the type(Quality) of water.  
Low,Moderate or good.  
And it detects either water is safe to drink or unsafe.
